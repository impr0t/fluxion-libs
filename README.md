============

Application support libraries for C# + Mono Framework.  Leverages GTK# for user interfaces.

Initial implementation of both a logging component and database component.

The database components are capable of consuming a class marked with custom attributes and creating a database table with it.

The Xlog logging components provide coded log records which can then be read using the Log Viewer.  The log viewer will decode the log data and provide color coding to log entries.
